### Eye Project
The SVG I created is trying to be a representation of an eye. I used polygons in the shape of triangles to create the eyelashes, circles to create the inner eye, and path objects to create the curves that make up the eye. I had initially used an elipsis to make up the outer eye, but I didn't think it did a good enough job since eyes tend to have a bit of a pointed end on either side, hence my decision to go with path objects. I also had a little fun with javascript and decided to make the eye color change randomly every half second.
